# TKYC - Truly Know Your Customer

This is our participation in the [Encode x MultiversX Hackathon](https://www.encode.club/multiversx-hackathon)!

## Overview

TKYC is an on-chain analysis solution, leveraging artificial intelligence.
With any address, we can determine the type of user it belongs to.

## Where can I start reviewing this project?

### Live website
Check our [live website](https://tkyc-frontend.onrender.com/). Due to the short duration of the hackathon, the live version is not using our AI model.
You can start by checking the [repo of the live website](https://github.com/MVX-TKYC/app). It contains the [frontend](https://github.com/MVX-TKYC/app/tree/main/client) and the [backend](https://github.com/MVX-TKYC/app/tree/main/server).  

### Getting data to train the IA
To train our AI, we used data from all wallets on the MultiversX blockchain with more than 50 transactions. 
This encompasses over 150,000 wallets, providing a comprehensive dataset for our advanced learning processes.

We created this [tool](https://github.com/MVX-TKYC/tools/blob/main/wallets_data_scrapper/README.md) to download the data.  
Here is a [link](https://www.swisstransfer.com/d/ed39b9c2-d2b2-4e68-9a40-b5b87b983928) to download the data used.

### WIP AI Model
The AI model is not totally finished, but you can check the [WIP AI repo](https://github.com/MVX-TKYC/ai) and the [technical paper](https://mathis-skipper.notion.site/Technical-Paper-AI-c247ebfd5a2e46f0b999f60cc1cb596e)
