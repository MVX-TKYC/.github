# Hey ðŸ‘‹

This is our participation in the [Encode x MultiversX Hackathon](https://www.encode.club/multiversx-hackathon)!

## Getting data to train the IA
To train our AI, we used data from all wallets on the MultiversX blockchain with more than 50 transactions. 
This encompasses over 150,000 wallets, providing a comprehensive dataset for our advanced learning processes.

We created this [tool](https://github.com/MVX-TKYC/tools/blob/main/wallets_data_scrapper/README.md) to download the data.  
Here is a [link](https://www.swisstransfer.com/d/ed39b9c2-d2b2-4e68-9a40-b5b87b983928) to download the data used.
