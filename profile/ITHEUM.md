# Why We Use Itheum

We use Itheum to simplify and streamline the process of creating and sending Secure Data NFTs (SFTs) on the blockchain. Itheum provides an easy-to-use SDK (Software Development Kit) that allows us to interact with the MultiversX blockchain and mint SFTs without the need for extensive technical knowledge.

The SDK handles the complex aspects of blockchain transactions, such as configuring addresses, managing transactions, and addressing potential issues like antispam tax. This means our development team can focus on building applications and services without getting bogged down in the intricacies of blockchain development.

In a nutshell, Itheum's SDK empowers us to create and manage Secure Data NFTs efficiently, making blockchain technology accessible and user-friendly for our projects.

# Expected Improvements

Our development team has identified several areas where improvements can enhance the usability and functionality of the Itheum SDK:

1. **Simplify Datamarshal URL Configuration:**
   - While appreciating the overall simplicity of the Itheum SDK, it's suggested that the need to configure the data marshal URL in the `SftMinter` could be streamlined or automated to reduce developer overhead.

2. **Clarify Antispam Tax Requirements:**
   - To avoid potential issues, it's recommended that clear and comprehensive requirements for handling the antispam tax be provided. This will help developers better understand and manage this aspect.

3. **Enhance SftMinter Functionality:**
   - To improve the usability of the SDK, it would be beneficial if the `SftMinter` module not only handled the creation of objects (tx) but also offered the option to directly sign contracts or send transactions. This extended functionality would make the SDK even more versatile and developer-friendly.

4. **SBT (Soul bound token)**
   - Our team would like to see Soul bound token freeze function in an NFT for near future from Itheum

We appreciate the hard work put into the Itheum SDK by the development team and look forward to these improvements to make the SDK even more efficient and user-friendly.
